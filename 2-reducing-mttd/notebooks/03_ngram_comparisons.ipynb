    "# Notebook 03: N-gram Baseline Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a **baseline exploration** to test whether n-gram metrics (word/phrase overlap) are useful for evaluating close notes quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:**\n",
    "1. We have an **incident dataset** with original problem descriptions\n",
    "2. We extracted some **high-quality close notes** from that dataset to serve as **ground truth references**\n",
    "3. Our goal is to evaluate close notes (existing ones or LLM-generated ones) against these ground truth references\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook's purpose:**\n",
    "- **Hypothesis:** Incident descriptions and close notes might use very different language, making n-gram metrics less useful\n",
    "- **Test:** Compare ground-truth close notes vs incident descriptions using n-gram metrics\n",
    "- **Goal:** Determine if n-grams are relevant, or if we should focus on LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation instead\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're comparing:**\n",
    "- **From Ground Truth Dataset:** Pairs of (`close_notes_ref`, `content`) from the **same incident**\n",
    "- **From Incidents Dataset:** Pairs of (`close_notes`, `content`) from the **same incident**\n",
    "- **Then compare:** N-gram scores between ground truth pairs vs incidents pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected outcome:** \n",
    "- If n-gram scores are very low for both datasets, it confirms that incident descriptions and close notes use different language\n",
    "- Comparing scores between datasets helps us understand if ground truth close notes differ more/less from descriptions than regular close notes\n",
    "- This validates that we should use **LLM-as-a-Judge** (semantic evaluation) rather than n-grams for the main evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are N-grams?\n",
    "\n",
    "**N-grams** are sequences of N words. For example:\n",
    "- **1-gram (unigram)**: Single words → \"the\", \"user\", \"reported\"\n",
    "- **2-gram (bigram)**: Pairs of words → \"the user\", \"user reported\", \"reported error\"\n",
    "- **3-gram (trigram)**: Three words → \"the user reported\", \"user reported error\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we're testing this:** N-grams measure **lexical overlap** (shared words/phrases). If incident descriptions and close notes use completely different vocabulary, n-grams won't be useful for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are ROUGE Metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROUGE** (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measures how well a text matches a reference by counting overlapping n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The metrics we'll use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ROUGE-1**: Measures word overlap (unigrams)\n",
    "   - *Example:* \"User reported error\" vs \"User saw error\" → Shares 2 words: \"User\" and \"error\"\n",
    "   - *What it tells us:* Do the texts use similar vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ROUGE-2**: Measures two-word phrase overlap (bigrams)\n",
    "   - *Example:* \"User reported error\" vs \"User reported issue\" → Shares 1 phrase: \"User reported\"\n",
    "   - *What it tells us:* Do the texts use similar word combinations?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ROUGE-L**: Measures longest common subsequence\n",
    "   - *Example:* Finds the longest sequence of words that appear in the same order in both texts\n",
    "   - *What it tells us:* How well do the texts follow similar sentence structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ROUGE-Lsum**: Similar to ROUGE-L but optimized for summaries\n",
    "   - *What it tells us:* How well does the text capture the main points?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score interpretation:**\n",
    "- **0.0** = No overlap (completely different texts)\n",
    "- **1.0** = Perfect match (identical texts)\n",
    "- **0.5** = Moderate similarity (half the words/phrases match)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our hypothesis:** Scores will be **low (0.1-0.3)** because:\n",
    "- Incident descriptions describe **problems** (\"User cannot login\")\n",
    "- Close notes describe **solutions** (\"Reset password and verified access\")\n",
    "- They use different vocabulary and structure\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. **Load** ground truth dataset and incidents dataset\n",
    "2. **Compare** ground-truth close notes vs incident descriptions using n-gram metrics\n",
    "3. **Calculate** ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-Lsum scores using Unitxt\n",
    "4. **Analyze** results to test our hypothesis\n",
    "5. **Conclude** whether n-grams are useful or if we should focus on LLM-as-a-Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 What We're Comparing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Comparison:**\n",
    "- **Ground Truth** (`gt_close_notes.csv`): High-quality close notes extracted from incidents\n",
    "  - Contains: `close_notes_ref` - well-written resolution notes\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Incidents** (`incidents_prepared.csv`): Original incident dataset\n",
    "  - Contains: `content` - the original problem description\n",
    "  - Also contains: `close_notes` - existing close notes (not used in this comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why compare ground-truth close notes vs incident descriptions?**\n",
    "- **To test if n-grams are relevant:** If scores are very low, it confirms that incident descriptions and close notes use different language\n",
    "- **Baseline for comparison:** Once we have LLM-generated close notes, we can compare them against ground truth using more sophisticated methods (LLM-as-a-Judge)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The **real evaluation** will happen in the next notebook using **LLM-as-a-Judge**, which evaluates:\n",
    "- Topic coverage\n",
    "- Accuracy of facts\n",
    "- Text structure\n",
    "- Completeness\n",
    "- And other semantic criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Using Unitxt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unitxt** is a standardized framework for evaluating text quality. It provides pre-built metrics that ensure consistent and comparable results across different evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Unitxt?** It standardizes how we compute metrics, making results reproducible and comparable across different evaluation phases.\n"

    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. For each pair (content, close_notes) from the same incident:\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-1**: Counts how many individual words appear in both texts\n",

    "## 📊 Summary: What Did We Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings from N-gram Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **N-gram metrics measure word/phrase overlap** between two texts\n",
    "2. **ROUGE scores tell us** how similar the vocabulary and phrases are\n",
    "3. **Expected result:** Low scores confirm that incident descriptions and close notes use different language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**If scores are LOW (0.1-0.3):**\n",
    "- ✅ **Confirms our hypothesis:** Incident descriptions and close notes use different vocabulary\n",
    "- ✅ **Conclusion:** N-grams are **not suitable** for evaluating close notes quality\n",
    "- ✅ **Next step:** Focus on **LLM-as-a-Judge** evaluation (semantic understanding)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If scores are HIGH (0.5+):**\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Surprising result:** Incident descriptions and close notes share significant vocabulary\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Conclusion:** N-grams might be useful, but we still need semantic evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This baseline analysis helps us understand:\n",
    "- **What metrics NOT to use:** If n-grams are low, they won't help evaluate close notes\n",
    "- **What to focus on:** LLM-as-a-Judge will evaluate semantic quality, not just word overlap\n",
    "- **Baseline for comparison:** We can compare future LLM-generated close notes against these ground truth references\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Next Steps: LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **real evaluation** will happen in the next phase using **LLM-as-a-Judge**, which will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compare close notes** (existing or LLM-generated) against ground truth references\n",
    "2. **Evaluate multiple criteria:**\n",
    "   - **Topic coverage:** Does the close note cover the same topics as the reference?\n",
    "   - **Profile data accuracy:** Is client/system information correct?\n",
    "   - **Supporting facts:** Are the facts consistent with the reference?\n",
    "   - **No invented facts:** Does it avoid making up information?\n",
    "   - **Text structure:** Is it well-organized and clear?\n",
    "   - **Conclusion quality:** Does it provide a clear resolution summary?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provide scores (0-5)** for each criterion, similar to the example provided:\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     \"check_topic_coverage\": 4,\n",

    "     \"general_score\": 4.67\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle context differences:** Each incident has different context, so evaluation will be relative to similar incidents/categories\n",
    "\n",
    "**This approach is more suitable** because:\n",
    "- It evaluates **meaning and quality**, not just word overlap\n",
    "- It can handle **different contexts** (each incident is unique)\n",
    "- It provides **explainable scores** with reasoning\n",
    "- It's **scalable** and doesn't require human labeling\n"
