    "# Notebook 05: LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates close notes quality using **LLM-as-a-Judge** - an automated evaluation method that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess close notes based on structured criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:**\n",
    "1. We have **two datasets:**\n",
    "   - **Reference Dataset** (good close notes) - High-quality examples\n",
    "   - **Other Incidents Dataset** (bad/regular close notes) - Standard examples\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. We want to **evaluate close notes** using multiple quality criteria:\n",
    "   - Does it provide useful information?\n",
    "   - Is it specific and detailed?\n",
    "   - Is it complete?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid generic phrases?\n",
    "   - Is it clear and well-written?\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook's purpose:**\n",
    "- **Set up evaluation criteria** - Define what makes a good close note\n",
    "- **Evaluate close notes** - Use LLM to judge quality across multiple dimensions\n",
    "- **Compare results** - See how good vs bad close notes score differently\n",
    "- **Understand scoring** - Learn what the scores mean and how to interpret them\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "- LLM-as-a-Judge provides structured, explainable evaluation\n",
    "- Good close notes score higher across all criteria\n",
    "- Bad close notes score lower, especially on specificity and completeness\n",
    "- This evaluation method can be used to assess AI-generated close notes\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LLM-as-a-Judge?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM-as-a-Judge** is a method where we use a Large Language Model (like Llama) to evaluate text quality, similar to how a human judge would evaluate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:**\n",
    "- **Human judge:** Reads a close note and gives it a score based on criteria\n",
    "- **LLM judge:** Does the same thing, but uses AI to be consistent and scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. We define **evaluation criteria** (what to look for)\n",
    "2. We provide the **close note** and **incident context** to the LLM\n",
    "3. The LLM **assesses** the close note against each criterion\n",
    "4. The LLM **selects an option** (e.g., \"Excellent\", \"Acceptable\", \"Bad\")\n",
    "5. We get a **score** (0.0 to 1.0) and **reasoning** (why that score was given)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Provides **consistent evaluation** (same criteria applied to all notes)\n",
    "- Gives **explainable scores** (we know why a score was given)\n",
    "- Can **scale** to evaluate many close notes automatically\n",
    "- Helps **identify** what makes a close note good or bad\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Evaluation Criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation criteria** are specific questions we ask about a close note's quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our 5 criteria:**\n",
    "1. **Informativeness** - Does it provide useful information?\n",
    "2. **Specificity** - Does it include specific details?\n",
    "3. **Completeness** - Does it cover all key aspects?\n",
    "4. **No Generic Statements** - Does it avoid generic phrases?\n",
    "5. **Clarity** - Is it well-written and clear?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each criterion has options:**\n",
    "- **Excellent** (score: 1.0) - Meets the criterion perfectly\n",
    "- **Acceptable** (score: 0.75) - Good but could be better\n",
    "- **Could be Improved** (score: 0.4-0.6) - Needs improvement\n",
    "- **Bad** (score: 0.0-0.2) - Doesn't meet the criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why multiple criteria?**\n",
    "- One score isn't enough - we need to understand **what** makes a close note good\n",
    "- Different close notes may be strong in different areas\n",
    "- Helps identify **specific improvements** needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Scoring Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring process:**\n",
    "1. LLM reads the close note and incident context\n",
    "2. For each criterion, LLM evaluates the close note\n",
    "3. LLM selects an option (e.g., \"Excellent\")\n",
    "4. Option is converted to a numeric score (e.g., 1.0)\n",
    "5. We get scores for all 5 criteria\n",
    "6. We calculate an **average score** across all criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score interpretation:**\n",
    "- **0.8 - 1.0** = Excellent close note (high quality)\n",
    "- **0.6 - 0.8** = Good close note (acceptable quality)\n",
    "- **0.4 - 0.6** = Needs improvement\n",
    "- **0.0 - 0.4** = Poor close note (low quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Close note scores: Informativeness=1.0, Specificity=0.8, Completeness=1.0, No Generic=1.0, Clarity=0.9\n",
    "- Average: **0.94** = Excellent quality close note!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. **Load** reference and other incidents datasets\n",
    "2. **Set up evaluation criteria** - Define 5 quality dimensions\n",
    "3. **Configure LLM-as-a-Judge** - Set up Ollama and Unitxt\n",
    "4. **Evaluate close notes** - Score close notes from both datasets\n",
    "5. **Compare results** - Analyze differences between good and bad close notes\n",
    "6. **Visualize scores** - Create charts showing score distributions\n",
    "7. **Interpret results** - Understand what the scores mean\n",

    "\n",
    "**Expected results:**\n",
    "- Reference close notes should score **higher** (0.7-1.0 average)\n",
    "- Other incidents should score **lower** (0.3-0.6 average)\n",
    "- Differences should be most obvious in **Specificity** and **No Generic Statements**\n",

    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "- ✅ LLM-as-a-Judge provides structured, explainable evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Good close notes score higher across multiple criteria\n",
    "- ✅ Specific criteria (like Specificity and No Generic Statements) strongly distinguish quality\n",
    "- ✅ This method can be used to evaluate AI-generated close notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:**\n",
    "- **Improvement:** Use evaluation results to guide LLM prompt engineering\n",
    "- **Scaling:** Evaluate more close notes to build a comprehensive quality assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this:**\n",
    "- Generate close notes using an LLM (Notebook 06)\n",
    "- Evaluate them using this same method\n",
    "- Compare scores to identify areas for improvement\n",
    "- Iterate on prompts to improve quality\n"
