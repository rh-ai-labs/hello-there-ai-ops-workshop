    "# Notebook 02: Define Quality and Separate Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps you understand what makes a \"good\" close note and separates your incident dataset into two groups:\n",
    "- **Reference Dataset** (high-quality close notes) - These will serve as examples of what good close notes look like\n",
    "- **Other Incidents Dataset** - All remaining incidents (for comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- We need clear examples of good close notes to compare against\n",
    "- These reference examples will be used to evaluate other close notes (existing or AI-generated)\n",
    "- By separating them, we can see the difference between high-quality and standard close notes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes a \"Good\" Close Note?\n",
    "\n",
    "A good close note should:\n",
    "1. **Be informative** - Contains specific details about the problem and solution\n",
    "2. **Be complete** - Covers what happened, what was done, and the outcome\n",
    "3. **Avoid generic phrases** - Doesn't just say \"Issue resolved\" without explanation\n",
    "4. **Be professional** - Clear, well-structured, and easy to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a GOOD close note:**\n",
    "> \"Investigated the reported issue with Workday crashing when saving files. Cleared browser cache and cookies, updated browser to latest version. Verified user can now save files successfully. Issue resolved and confirmed with user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a BAD/Generic close note:**\n",
    "> \"Issue resolved.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the difference matters:**\n",
    "- Good close notes help others understand what happened and how it was fixed\n",
    "- Generic close notes don't provide useful information\n",
    "- We'll use good examples as \"reference\" to evaluate other close notes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. **Define quality criteria** - Explain what makes a close note \"good\"\n",
    "2. **Examine quality scores** - Look at how close notes are scored\n",
    "3. **Filter high-quality examples** - Identify close notes that meet our criteria\n",
    "4. **Separate into two datasets:**\n",
    "   - **Reference Dataset** - High-quality close notes (ground truth)\n",
    "   - **Other Incidents Dataset** - Remaining incidents (for comparison)\n",
    "5. **Save datasets** - Save both for use in later notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 How We'll Separate the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separation Strategy:**\n",
    "- **Reference Dataset** (`reference_close_notes.csv`): \n",
    "  - High-quality close notes that meet all criteria\n",
    "  - Will be used as examples/references for evaluation\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Other Incidents Dataset**:\n",
    "  - All incidents that don't meet the \"high-quality\" criteria\n",
    "  - Will be used for comparison in later notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection Criteria for Reference Dataset:**\n",
    "- High information score (`info_score_close_notes` ≥ 0.8)\n",
    "- Low generic content score (`info_score_poor_close_notes` ≤ 0.1)\n",
    "- Complete and informative text (not just \"Issue resolved\")\n",
    "- Minimum length (ensures sufficient detail)\n",
    "- Diverse examples across different categories\n"
