    "# Notebook 05: LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates close notes quality using **LLM-as-a-Judge** - an automated evaluation method that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess close notes based on structured criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:**\n",
    "1. We have **two datasets:**\n",
    "   - **Reference Dataset** (good close notes) - High-quality examples\n",
    "   - **Other Incidents Dataset** (bad/regular close notes) - Standard examples\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. We want to **evaluate close notes** using multiple quality criteria:\n",
    "   - Does it provide useful information?\n",
    "   - Is it specific and detailed?\n",
    "   - Is it complete?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid generic phrases?\n",
    "   - Is it clear and well-written?\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook's purpose:**\n",
    "- **Set up evaluation criteria** - Define what makes a good close note\n",
    "- **Evaluate close notes** - Use LLM to judge quality across multiple dimensions\n",
    "- **Compare results** - See how good vs bad close notes score differently\n",
    "- **Understand scoring** - Learn what the scores mean and how to interpret them\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "- LLM-as-a-Judge provides structured, explainable evaluation\n",
    "- Good close notes score higher across all criteria\n",
    "- Bad close notes score lower, especially on specificity and completeness\n",
    "- This evaluation method can be used to assess AI-generated close notes\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LLM-as-a-Judge?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM-as-a-Judge** is a method where we use a Large Language Model (like Llama) to evaluate text quality, similar to how a human judge would evaluate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:**\n",
    "- **Human judge:** Reads a close note and gives it a score based on criteria\n",
    "- **LLM judge:** Does the same thing, but uses AI to be consistent and scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. We define **evaluation criteria** (what to look for)\n",
    "2. We provide the **close note** and **incident context** to the LLM\n",
    "3. The LLM **assesses** the close note against each criterion\n",
    "4. The LLM **selects an option** (e.g., \"Excellent\", \"Acceptable\", \"Bad\")\n",
    "5. We get a **score** (0.0 to 1.0) and **reasoning** (why that score was given)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Provides **consistent evaluation** (same criteria applied to all notes)\n",
    "- Gives **explainable scores** (we know why a score was given)\n",
    "- Can **scale** to evaluate many close notes automatically\n",
    "- Helps **identify** what makes a close note good or bad\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Evaluation Criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation criteria** are specific questions we ask about a close note's quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our 5 criteria:**\n",
    "1. **Informativeness** - Does it provide useful information?\n",
    "2. **Specificity** - Does it include specific details?\n",
    "3. **Completeness** - Does it cover all key aspects?\n",
    "4. **No Generic Statements** - Does it avoid generic phrases?\n",
    "5. **Clarity** - Is it well-written and clear?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each criterion has options:**\n",
    "- **Excellent** (score: 1.0) - Meets the criterion perfectly\n",
    "- **Acceptable** (score: 0.75) - Good but could be better\n",
    "- **Could be Improved** (score: 0.4-0.6) - Needs improvement\n",
    "- **Bad** (score: 0.0-0.2) - Doesn't meet the criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why multiple criteria?**\n",
    "- One score isn't enough - we need to understand **what** makes a close note good\n",
    "- Different close notes may be strong in different areas\n",
    "- Helps identify **specific improvements** needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Scoring Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring process:**\n",
    "1. LLM reads the close note and incident context\n",
    "2. For each criterion, LLM evaluates the close note\n",
    "3. LLM selects an option (e.g., \"Excellent\")\n",
    "4. Option is converted to a numeric score (e.g., 1.0)\n",
    "5. We get scores for all 5 criteria\n",
    "6. We calculate an **average score** across all criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score interpretation:**\n",
    "- **0.8 - 1.0** = Excellent close note (high quality)\n",
    "- **0.6 - 0.8** = Good close note (acceptable quality)\n",
    "- **0.4 - 0.6** = Needs improvement\n",
    "- **0.0 - 0.4** = Poor close note (low quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Close note scores: Informativeness=1.0, Specificity=0.8, Completeness=1.0, No Generic=1.0, Clarity=0.9\n",
    "- Average: **0.94** = Excellent quality close note!\n",
    "\n",

    "## 💼 How This Applies to IT Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "What you just built is a production-ready quality evaluation system for IT operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "- **Automated Quality Scoring:** Use LLM-as-a-Judge to automatically score all new close notes\n",
    "- **Agent Feedback:** Show agents exactly where their documentation needs improvement (specific criteria)\n",
    "- **Quality Monitoring:** Set up automated alerts for close notes that score below threshold\n",
    "- **Training Data:** Use evaluation results to train AI models to generate better close notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Pattern:**\n",
    "1. **Define criteria** - What makes good documentation? (You did this!)\n",
    "2. **Evaluate automatically** - Use LLM-as-a-Judge to score all close notes\n",
    "3. **Provide feedback** - Show agents specific areas for improvement\n",
    "4. **Measure improvement** - Track quality scores over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** In IT operations, consistent documentation quality reduces MTTD. When agents write good close notes, future incidents are resolved faster. LLM-as-a-Judge provides automated, consistent, explainable quality assessment at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Use Cases:**\n",
    "- **Real-time Quality Checks:** Evaluate close notes as they're written, provide instant feedback\n",
    "- **Quality Dashboards:** Track documentation quality metrics across teams\n",
    "- **Agent Coaching:** Use evaluation results to coach agents on specific criteria\n",
    "- **AI Training:** Use high-scoring examples to train AI models\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Ensure documentation meets organizational standards automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration Points:**\n",
    "- **Ticketing Systems:** Integrate evaluation into ServiceNow, Jira, etc.\n",
    "- **Workflow Automation:** Auto-flag low-quality close notes for review\n",
    "- **Reporting:** Generate quality reports for management\n",
    "- **Continuous Improvement:** Use scores to identify training needs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM-as-a-Judge works!** - It provides structured, explainable evaluation that actually distinguishes good from bad\n",
    "- **Multiple criteria matter** - One score isn't enough; you need to understand what makes documentation good\n",
    "- **Explainable scores** - Unlike simple metrics, you get reasoning for each score\n",
    "- **Scalable evaluation** - Can evaluate thousands of close notes automatically\n",
    "- **Better than n-grams** - Understands meaning and quality, not just word overlap\n",
    "- **Better than semantic similarity alone** - Provides structured evaluation across multiple dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights from this notebook:**\n",
    "- Good close notes score higher across ALL criteria (not just one)\n",
    "- Specificity and \"No Generic Statements\" are the strongest differentiators\n",
    "- LLM-as-a-Judge provides consistent, explainable evaluation\n",
    "- This method can evaluate both human-written and AI-generated close notes\n",
    "- Evaluation results can guide prompt engineering for better AI outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you accomplished:**\n",
    "- ✅ Set up LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework\n",
    "- ✅ Evaluated close notes across 5 quality criteria\n",
    "- ✅ Compared good vs bad close notes systematically\n",
    "- ✅ Validated that structured evaluation works for quality assessment\n",
    "- ✅ Built a production-ready evaluation system\n",

    "- ✅ Multiple evaluation methods tested and validated\n",
    "- ✅ Production-ready quality assessment system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Next Steps:**\n",
    "- **Notebook 06 (if created):** Generate close notes using LLM and evaluate them\n",
    "- **Apply to your data:** Use this workflow with your own incident data\n",
    "- **Build automation:** Integrate evaluation into your ticketing workflow\n",
    "- **Monitor quality:** Set up dashboards to track documentation quality over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this in production:**\n",
    "1. **Set up evaluation** - Use the same criteria and framework\n",
    "2. **Evaluate new close notes** - Run LLM-as-a-Judge on all new documentation\n",
    "3. **Provide feedback** - Show agents where they can improve\n",
    "4. **Track metrics** - Monitor quality scores over time\n",
    "5. **Iterate** - Refine criteria based on your organization's needs\n",
