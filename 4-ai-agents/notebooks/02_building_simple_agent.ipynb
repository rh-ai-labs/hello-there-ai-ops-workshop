    "# Notebook 02: Building a Simple Agent with Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 02! This notebook shows you how to build autonomous agents with **client-side tools** - Python functions that agents can use to take actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll do:**\n",
    "- Create a Wikipedia search tool (simple example, no API key needed)\n",
    "- Build an agent that uses tools to answer questions\n",
    "- Create IT operations tools for managing infrastructure\n",
    "- See how agents automatically detect tools from function docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Tools give agents the ability to act, not just think. Client-side tools are simple Python functions with docstrings - no complex configuration needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:** In Notebook 01, we saw how agents reason. Now we'll give agents \"hands\" - tools they can use to take actions. Client-side tools run in your Python process, making them fast and secure for prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-Side Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they are:** Python functions with docstrings that agents can call to perform actions. They run in your Python process, not on a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why they matter:** Tools give agents the ability to act. Without tools, agents can only think and respond - with tools, they can actually do things!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** An agent without tools = a consultant who can only give advice. An agent with tools = a consultant who can actually fix things.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:** You write a Python function with a clear docstring → The agent reads the docstring → When needed, the agent calls the function → Function executes and returns results → Agent uses results to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstrings: The Secret Sauce\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they are:** Text descriptions in triple quotes that explain what a function does, what parameters it takes, and when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why they matter:** The agent doesn't see your code - it only sees the docstring. A good docstring makes the difference between a tool the agent uses correctly and one it ignores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A menu description. A good description makes you want to order the dish and tells you what to expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Registry & Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Registry:** A dictionary that maps tool names to functions (`{\"tool_name\": function}`). It tells the agent what tools are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sessions:** Maintain conversation context - agents remember what happened in previous turns, enabling multi-step operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** Registry = a toolbox (list of available tools). Session = a phone call (maintains context throughout).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what client-side tools are and how they work\n",
    "- ✅ Know how to create tools using Python functions with docstrings\n",
    "- ✅ See how agents automatically detect and use tools\n",
    "- ✅ Build an agent that uses tools to answer questions\n",
    "- ✅ Create IT operations tools for infrastructure management\n",
    "- ✅ Understand the difference between client-side tools and MCP tools (covered in Notebook 04)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "- ✅ Completed Notebook 01: Introduction to Agents (understanding of agents and the agent loop)\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaStack server running (see Module README)\n",
    "- ✅ Python environment with dependencies installed (`llama-stack-client`, `requests`)\n",
    "- ✅ Basic understanding of Python functions and docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** No MCP servers needed yet! We're building client-side tools that run in your Python process.\n"

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client-Side Tools** are Python functions with docstrings - the agent detects them automatically (no complex configuration!)\n",
    "2. **Docstrings are Critical** - The agent reads docstrings to understand what tools do and when to use them\n",
    "3. **Tool Registry** - A simple dictionary that maps tool names to functions\n",
    "4. **Sessions** maintain conversation context - agents remember what happened in previous turns\n",
    "5. **Multi-Step Operations** - Agents can use multiple tools in sequence to solve complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- Tools are the agent's \"hands\" - they let agents take actions, not just think\n",
    "- Client-side tools run in your Python process - fast, secure, no external dependencies\n",
    "- The pattern is simple: function + docstring + registry = tool the agent can use\n",
    "- You can build any tool you need - Wikipedia, IT operations, databases, APIs, anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Build tools for your specific infrastructure (monitoring systems, service management, etc.)\n",
    "- Watch agents reason about problems and choose the right tools\n",
    "- See agents execute multi-step operations (check status → detect problem → fix it)\n",
    "- Create production-ready agents that can actually manage your systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client-Side vs. MCP Tools:**\n",
    "- **Client-Side (This Notebook):** Simple, fast, runs in your process - perfect for prototyping\n",
    "- **MCP Tools (Notebook 04):** External services, standardized protocol - perfect for production\n",
