    "# Notebook 05: Multi-Metric Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 05! In this notebook, we'll explore **multi-metric evaluation** - a powerful way to measure how well your AI agents are performing. Think of it like a report card for your AI, but instead of just one grade, you get multiple grades that tell you different things about performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. **Basic Evaluation** - Using simple scoring functions to check if answers match expectations\n",
    "2. **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation** - Using an AI model to evaluate other AI responses (like having a teacher grade student work)\n",
    "3. **Multi-Metric Evaluation** - Evaluating the same responses with multiple criteria at once\n",
    "4. **Understanding Results** - How to read and interpret evaluation scores and feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- **You can't improve what you don't measure** - Evaluation tells you if your agents are actually working well\n",
    "- **Multiple perspectives** - Different metrics reveal different strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "- **Beyond exact matches** - LLM-as-judge understands meaning, not just word-for-word matches\n",
    "- **Actionable feedback** - Judge feedback explains why scores were given, helping you improve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** When you get a car inspected, they check multiple things - brakes, engine, lights, emissions. Each check tells you something different. Multi-metric evaluation does the same for your AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept 1: Evaluation Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A benchmark is like a standardized test for your AI agent. It contains a set of questions and expected answers that you use to measure performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Benchmarks let you compare performance over time. Did your agent get better after you made changes? The benchmark tells you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A driving test. Everyone takes the same test, so you can compare how well different drivers perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept 2: Scoring Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A scoring function is a way to measure how good an answer is. It takes a question, expected answer, and generated answer, then gives a score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Different scoring functions measure different things. Some check for exact matches, others check for meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** Different types of tests:\n",
    "- **Basic scoring** = Multiple choice (exact match)\n",
    "- **LLM-as-judge** = Essay grading (understands meaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept 3: LLM-as-Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Using one AI model (the \"judge\") to evaluate responses from another AI model (the \"candidate\"). The judge reads both the question and answer, then scores it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** LLM-as-judge understands context and meaning, not just exact word matches. It can tell if an answer is helpful even if it uses different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A teacher grading essays. The teacher understands the meaning, not just whether specific words were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept 4: Multi-Metric Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Evaluating the same responses using multiple scoring functions at once. Each function measures a different aspect (accuracy, helpfulness, safety, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** One metric alone doesn't tell the whole story. Multiple metrics give you a complete picture of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A job performance review that evaluates multiple skills - technical ability, communication, teamwork, etc. Each skill matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what evaluation benchmarks are and how to create them\n",
    "- ✅ Know how to use basic scoring functions for simple checks\n",
    "- ✅ Learn how to configure LLM-as-judge functions for nuanced evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Be able to run multi-metric evaluations that measure multiple aspects at once\n",
    "- ✅ Know how to interpret evaluation results and use judge feedback to improve your agents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluation Benchmarks** - Create standardized tests to measure agent performance consistently over time\n",
    "2. **Basic Scoring Functions** - Use simple functions like `subset_of` for fast, reliable exact-match checks\n",
    "3. **LLM-as-Judge** - Configure AI models to evaluate other AI responses, understanding meaning beyond exact words\n",
    "4. **Multi-Metric Evaluation** - Evaluate the same responses using multiple criteria to get a comprehensive performance view\n",
    "5. **Result Analysis** - Use tables and judge feedback to understand performance and identify improvement opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **You can't improve what you don't measure** - Evaluation is essential for understanding if your agents are actually working well\n",
    "- **Multiple metrics tell the whole story** - One metric alone doesn't capture everything. Accuracy, helpfulness, and safety all matter\n",
    "- **LLM-as-judge understands meaning** - Unlike basic matching, LLM-as-judge can evaluate whether answers are helpful even if they use different words\n",
    "- **Judge feedback is actionable** - The explanations help you understand why scores were given and how to improve\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- **Measure objectively** - Use evaluation to prove your agents are working well, not just assume they are\n",
    "- **Demonstrate value** - Show stakeholders concrete metrics and improvement over time\n",
    "- **Iterate and improve** - Use evaluation feedback to identify weaknesses and refine your agents\n",
    "- **Quality gates** - Ensure agents meet standards before deploying to production\n",
    "\n",

    "You now know how to:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what autonomous agents are and how they work (Notebook 01)\n",
    "- ✅ Build simple agents with tools and memory (Notebook 02)\n",
    "- ✅ Use LlamaStack's core features - Chat and RAG (Notebook 03)\n",
    "- ✅ Integrate tools using MCP (Notebook 04)\n",
    "- ✅ Evaluate agent performance with multiple metrics (Notebook 05)\n",

    "**What's next?**\n",
    "- Build agents for your specific IT operations use cases\n",
    "- Integrate with your monitoring systems, ticketing systems, and databases\n",
    "- Deploy agents with proper evaluation and monitoring\n",
    "- Continuously measure and improve agent performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** You now have all the tools to build agents that can actually manage your IT infrastructure - autonomously, safely, and measurably!\n",
