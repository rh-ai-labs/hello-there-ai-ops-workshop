    "# Notebook 04: MCP Tools - Integrating External Tools with Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 04! This notebook introduces you to **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - a standardized way to integrate external tools and services with autonomous agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll do:**\n",
    "- Understand what MCP is and why it matters\n",
    "- Learn how MCP differs from client-side tools\n",
    "- Connect agents to external MCP servers (like MongoDB)\n",
    "- See agents use MCP tools to interact with databases and external services\n",
    "- Understand when to use MCP vs. client-side tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- In Notebook 02, we built client-side tools (like Wikipedia search) that run in your Python process\n",
    "- MCP tools connect agents to **external services** - databases, APIs, monitoring systems, anything!\n",
    "- This is how you build production agents that interact with your real IT infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "Think of client-side tools as \"local helpers\" and MCP tools as \"remote services.\" MCP provides a standardized protocol so agents can safely connect to external systems - databases, ticketing systems, monitoring APIs, cloud services, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world impact:**\n",
    "- **Database integration:** Agents can query databases, update records, analyze data\n",
    "- **API integration:** Connect to any REST API, GraphQL endpoint, or service\n",
    "- **Infrastructure tools:** Integrate with monitoring systems, service management, cloud platforms\n",
    "- **Standardized protocol:** One way to connect to everything, making agents portable and reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** You'll see agents querying MongoDB databases and using external tools - just like they would in production!\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A protocol (like HTTP or REST) that defines how agents communicate with external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Instead of every tool having its own integration method, MCP provides one standard way to connect agents to any external service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** \n",
    "- **Client-side tools** = Local functions in your Python code (like the Wikipedia search from Notebook 02)\n",
    "- **MCP tools** = Remote services you connect to via a standard protocol (like databases, APIs, monitoring systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. An **MCP server** exposes tools (like a database query tool, API call tool, etc.)\n",
    "2. The **agent** connects to the MCP server\n",
    "3. The agent can discover available tools and call them\n",
    "4. Tools execute on the server and return results to the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP vs. Client-Side Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client-Side Tools (Notebook 02):**\n",
    "- ✅ Simple to create (just Python functions)\n",
    "- ✅ Fast (run in your process)\n",
    "- ✅ No network overhead\n",
    "- ❌ Limited to what you can do in Python\n",
    "- ❌ Can't access remote services easily\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP Tools (This Notebook):**\n",
    "- ✅ Connect to external services (databases, APIs, etc.)\n",
    "- ✅ Standardized protocol (works with any MCP-compatible service)\n",
    "- ✅ Can be shared across multiple agents\n",
    "- ✅ Run on dedicated servers (better for production)\n",
    "- ❌ Requires MCP server setup\n",
    "- ❌ Network latency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:**\n",
    "- **Client-side tools** = Local library books (fast, easy, but limited selection)\n",
    "- **MCP tools** = Inter-library loan system (access to everything, but requires connection)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use each:**\n",
    "- **Client-side:** Simple operations, no external dependencies, prototyping\n",
    "- **MCP:** External services, production systems, shared tools across agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Server\n",
    "\n",
    "An **MCP server** is a service that exposes tools via the MCP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A server (like a web API) that implements the MCP protocol and provides tools to agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** MCP servers let you expose any service as tools - databases, APIs, monitoring systems, anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A restaurant menu. The MCP server is the restaurant (provides the menu of tools), and the agent is the customer (orders from the menu).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **MongoDB MCP Server:** Exposes database operations as tools (query, insert, update)\n",
    "- **Terminal MCP Server:** Exposes safe terminal commands as tools\n",
    "- **Monitoring MCP Server:** Exposes monitoring API calls as tools\n",
    "- **Custom MCP Server:** You can build your own for any service!\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Tools in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "When an agent uses an MCP tool:\n",
    "1. **Agent reasons:** \"I need to query the database\"\n",
    "2. **Agent discovers tools:** Checks what MCP tools are available\n",
    "3. **Agent calls tool:** Sends request to MCP server\n",
    "4. **MCP server executes:** Runs the actual operation (database query, API call, etc.)\n",
    "5. **Results return:** MCP server sends results back to agent\n",
    "6. **Agent continues:** Uses results to complete the task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A customer service agent calling a specialist department. The agent doesn't know how to do everything, but knows who to call (which tool to use) and how to ask (MCP protocol).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",

    "- ✅ Know when to use MCP tools vs. client-side tools\n",
    "- ✅ Connect agents to MCP servers\n",
    "- ✅ See agents use MCP tools to interact with external services\n",
    "- ✅ Understand how to build production-ready agents with external integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "- ✅ Completed Notebook 02: Building a Simple Agent (understanding of agents and tools)\n",
    "- ✅ Completed Notebook 03: LlamaStack Core Features (understanding of Chat and RAG)\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaStack server running (see Module README)\n",
    "- ✅ MongoDB MCP server running (or access to one)\n",
    "- ✅ Python environment with dependencies installed (`llama-stack-client`, `httpx`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This notebook requires an MCP server to be running. We'll use a MongoDB MCP server as an example, but the concepts apply to any MCP server.\n",

    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standardized way to connect agents to external tools and services\n",
    "2. **MCP vs. Client-Side Tools:** MCP connects to external services, client-side tools run in your process\n",
    "3. **MCP Servers** expose tools via a standard protocol - databases, APIs, monitoring systems, anything!\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Tool Discovery:** Agents discover MCP tools automatically - no need to pre-configure them\n",
    "5. **Production-Ready:** MCP enables agents to interact with real IT infrastructure safely and securely\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized way to connect agents to any external service\n",
    "- This enables production agents that interact with databases, APIs, monitoring systems, and more\n",
    "- MCP tools run on dedicated servers, making them scalable and secure\n",
    "- The protocol is standardized, so agents can work with any MCP-compatible service\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Connect agents to your monitoring systems via MCP\n",
    "- Integrate with ticketing systems, databases, and APIs\n",
    "- Build production-ready agents that interact with your infrastructure\n",
    "- Use standardized protocol for easy integration and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use MCP vs. Client-Side Tools:**\n",
    "- **Use MCP:** External services, production systems, shared tools, databases, APIs\n",
    "- **Use Client-Side:** Simple operations, prototyping, no external dependencies\n",
