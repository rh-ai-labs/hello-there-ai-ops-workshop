    "# Notebook 01: Introduction to Autonomous Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Module 5! This notebook introduces you to **autonomous agents** - AI systems that can not only analyze problems but also take actions to fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. **What autonomous agents are** and how they differ from traditional automation\n",
    "2. **How agents work** - the perception, reasoning, action, and learning cycle\n",
    "3. **Why agents matter** for IT operations\n",
    "4. **A simple example** of an agent making decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Previous modules showed how AI can analyze and recommend solutions\n",
    "- This module shows how AI can actually **take actions** to fix problems\n",
    "- This is the next step: from analysis to autonomous remediation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "- ✅ Python 3.11+ installed\n",
    "- ✅ Basic understanding of Python programming\n",
    "- ✅ Familiarity with IT operations concepts (services, monitoring, incidents)\n",
    "- ✅ Completed previous modules (optional but recommended for context)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** No LlamaStack server needed yet! We're starting with simulated environments to understand the concepts first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Autonomous Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **autonomous agent** is a system that can:\n",
    "1. **Perceive** - Gather information about its environment\n",
    "2. **Reason** - Think about what it perceives and decide what to do\n",
    "3. **Act** - Take actions to achieve goals\n",
    "4. **Learn** - Improve from the results of its actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A human IT operator, but automated and always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent vs. Traditional Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Automation:**\n",
    "- Follows fixed rules: \"If service is down, restart it\"\n",
    "- No reasoning or adaptation\n",
    "- Works well for predictable scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autonomous Agent:**\n",
    "- Uses AI to reason: \"Service is down. Let me check why, then decide the best fix\"\n",
    "- Can adapt to new situations\n",
    "- Learns from experience\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **Automation:** \"If CPU > 90%, restart service\"\n",
    "- **Agent:** \"CPU is high. Let me check if it's a temporary spike or sustained load. If sustained, I'll scale up resources. If spike, I'll investigate the cause first.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents work in a continuous loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────┐\n",
    "│  Observe    │ ← Gather information about environment\n",
    "└──────┬──────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "┌──────▼──────┐\n",
    "│   Think     │ ← Analyze, reason, plan what to do\n",
    "└──────┬──────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "┌──────▼──────┐\n",
    "│    Act      │ ← Execute actions using tools\n",
    "└──────┬──────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "┌──────▼──────┐\n",
    "│   Learn     │ ← Remember what worked, improve\n",
    "└──────┬──────┘\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       └──────→ Loop back to Observe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools: What Agents Can Do\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are the actions an agent can take. Examples:\n",
    "- `check_service_status` - Check if a service is running\n",
    "- `restart_service` - Restart a failed service\n",
    "- `scale_service` - Add more resources\n",
    "- `get_logs` - Read service logs\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent uses AI reasoning to decide which tool to use and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what autonomous agents are\n",
    "- ✅ Know how agents differ from traditional automation\n",
    "- ✅ See a simple example of agent reasoning\n",
    "- ✅ Be ready to build your own agent in the next notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 How This Applies to IT Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** Traditional automation is rigid. It follows fixed rules like \"if service is down, restart it\" - but what if restarting doesn't fix it? What if the service is down because of a dependency issue? Traditional automation fails here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** Autonomous agents reason about problems. They observe, think, act, and learn - just like a human operator, but available 24/7 and never gets tired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world impact:**\n",
    "- **Reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve):** Agents can detect and fix issues faster than humans\n",
    "- **Scale operations:** One agent can monitor hundreds of services simultaneously\n",
    "- **Learn from incidents:** Agents remember what worked and improve over time\n",
    "- **Handle edge cases:** Agents can reason about situations they haven't seen before\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** We'll start with a simulated environment (like a flight simulator) so you can experiment safely before deploying to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Safety Note\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is an educational module.** The agents we build work with a **simulated environment** for safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real IT environments:\n",
    "- ✅ Always implement approval gates for critical actions\n",
    "- ✅ Use dry-run mode for testing\n",
    "- ✅ Start with read-only operations\n",
    "- ✅ Gradually enable actions with proper safeguards\n",
    "- ✅ Implement comprehensive logging and auditing\n",

    "1. **Autonomous agents** can perceive, reason, act, and learn - they're like having a smart IT operator that never sleeps\n",
    "2. **Tools** are the actions agents can take (like `restart_service`, `scale_service`) - think of them as the agent's hands\n",
    "3. **Reasoning** is what makes agents different from simple automation - agents think before acting, automation just follows rules\n",

    "- They can adapt to new problems they haven't seen before (unlike traditional automation)\n",

    "- For IT operations, this means 24/7 monitoring, faster incident resolution, and reduced MTTR\n",

    "**Safety first:**\n",
    "- Always start with read-only operations\n",
    "- Implement approval gates for critical actions\n",
