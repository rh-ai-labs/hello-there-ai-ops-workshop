    "# Notebook 03: LlamaStack Core Features\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 03! This notebook explores **LlamaStack's core capabilities** - Chat and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - the building blocks that make powerful agents possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll do:**\n",
    "- Understand Simple Chat - basic LLM interactions for Q&A and text generation\n",
    "- Explore RAG - giving agents access to your documentation and knowledge bases\n",
    "- Learn when to use each feature and how they work together\n",
    "- See practical examples for IT operations use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Chat is the foundation - everything else builds on this\n",
    "- RAG gives agents access to YOUR documentation (runbooks, procedures, internal docs)\n",
    "- Understanding these features helps you build better agents\n",
    "- This knowledge prepares you for advanced agent development (MCP tools, safety, evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **Chat** = General Q&A using the LLM's training data\n",
    "- **RAG** = Domain-specific Q&A using YOUR documents\n",
    "- **Together** = Agents that can answer general questions AND questions about your specific infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world impact:**\n",
    "- **Chat:** Answer general IT questions (\"What is a load balancer?\")\n",
    "- **RAG:** Answer questions about YOUR infrastructure (\"How do we restart services in our setup?\")\n",
    "- **Combined:** Agents that understand both general IT concepts and your specific procedures\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Chat\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chat** is the most basic way to interact with an LLM - a conversation where you send messages and receive responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Direct interaction with an LLM - send a message, get a response. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Chat is the foundation. Everything else (RAG, tools, agents) builds on this basic capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** Talking to a knowledgeable colleague. You ask questions, they answer based on what they know.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. You send a message (user message)\n",
    "2. Optionally set context (system prompt - defines the assistant's role)\n",
    "3. LLM generates a response based on its training data\n",
    "4. You can continue the conversation (multi-turn) - the LLM remembers context\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- ✅ General Q&A (\"What is a load balancer?\")\n",
    "- ✅ Text generation (summaries, explanations)\n",
    "- ✅ Basic reasoning tasks\n",
    "- ❌ Don't use when you need external knowledge or tools (use RAG or MCP instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG** enhances LLMs with external knowledge by retrieving relevant documents and using them as context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A technique that combines document retrieval with text generation. Store your docs in a vector store, search for relevant context, and use that context to generate better answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** LLMs have training data cutoff dates and can't access private/internal documents. RAG gives agents access to YOUR documentation - runbooks, procedures, internal knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A librarian who can search your internal wiki and use those documents to answer questions. The LLM doesn't just rely on its training - it uses YOUR docs!\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. **Store:** Documents are stored in a vector database (vector store) with embeddings\n",
    "2. **Search:** When you ask a question, the system searches for semantically similar documents\n",
    "3. **Retrieve:** Relevant documents are retrieved based on meaning (not just keywords)\n",
    "4. **Augment:** Retrieved documents are added as context to the LLM prompt\n",
    "5. **Generate:** The LLM generates an answer using both its training data AND your documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- ✅ Need access to specific documents (runbooks, procedures)\n",
    "- ✅ Domain-specific knowledge required (your infrastructure)\n",
    "- ✅ Private/internal information (internal docs, configurations)\n",
    "- ✅ Up-to-date information needed (current procedures, recent changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector store** is a database that stores documents as embeddings (vector representations) for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A specialized database that stores documents and their embeddings, enabling semantic search (finding documents by meaning, not just keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Vector stores enable RAG - they're where your documents live and how the system finds relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A smart filing cabinet. Instead of searching by filename or keywords, you search by meaning - \"find documents about restarting services\" finds relevant docs even if they don't contain those exact words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**System prompts** are instructions that guide the LLM's behavior - they set the \"personality\" and \"role\" of the assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they are:** Special messages that define how the assistant should behave, what role it plays, and what context it should consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why they matter:** System prompts ensure consistent, domain-appropriate responses. They tell the LLM \"you are an IT operations assistant\" so it responds accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A job description. The system prompt tells the LLM what job it's doing and how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Chat** is the foundation - basic LLM interactions for Q&A and text generation\n",
    "2. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** gives agents access to YOUR documentation - store docs, retrieve context, answer questions!\n",
    "3. **System prompts** guide the LLM's behavior - set the role, personality, and domain\n",
    "4. **Multi-turn conversations** maintain context - agents remember what you talked about\n",
    "5. **Streaming** provides real-time feedback - see responses as they're generated\n",
    "6. **Vector stores** enable RAG - store documents as embeddings for semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **Chat** for general Q&A - when you need general knowledge\n",
    "- **RAG** for domain-specific knowledge - when you need YOUR docs\n",
    "- **Combine both** - agents can answer general questions AND questions about your specific setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Use **Chat** for general IT questions (\"What is a load balancer?\")\n",
    "- Use **RAG** for your specific procedures (\"How do we restart services in our infrastructure?\")\n",
    "- Store your runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and documentation in vector stores\n",
    "- Give agents access to your internal knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use each:**\n",
    "- **Chat:** General Q&A, text generation, basic reasoning\n",
    "- **RAG:** Domain-specific knowledge, private/internal docs, up-to-date information\n",
    "- **Together:** Agents that understand both general concepts and your specific infrastructure\n",
