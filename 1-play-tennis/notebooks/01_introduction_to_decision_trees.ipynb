    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first hands-on experience with AI! This notebook introduces you to **decision trees** - one of the most intuitive machine learning algorithms - through a fun, relatable example: predicting whether to play tennis based on weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll do:**\n",
    "1. **Explore the problem** - Understand what we're trying to predict and why it matters\n",
    "2. **Load and examine data** - See what information we have to work with\n",
    "3. **Prepare the data** - Get it ready for the machine learning algorithm\n",
    "4. **Train a decision tree** - Teach the computer to make predictions\n",
    "5. **Evaluate the model** - See how well it performs\n",
    "6. **Visualize the tree** - Understand how the model makes decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Decision trees are the foundation for many advanced AI techniques\n",
    "- This example shows how AI can learn patterns from data\n",
    "- You'll understand the basic workflow used in all machine learning projects\n",
    "- This knowledge applies directly to IT operations (predicting incidents, classifying problems, routing tickets, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it connects:**\n",
    "- This is Module 1 of the workshop - your introduction to AI concepts\n",
    "- The skills you learn here will be used throughout the workshop\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a way for computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** Teaching a child to recognize cats by showing them many cat pictures, rather than describing every possible cat feature. The child learns the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** In IT operations, we can't write rules for every possible incident. ML learns patterns from historical data to help predict and classify new situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decision tree** is a simple, visual way to make decisions by asking a series of yes/no questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A flowchart or a game of \"20 Questions\" - you ask questions that narrow down the possibilities until you reach an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "- \"Is it sunny?\" → Yes → \"Is it windy?\" → No → \"Play tennis!\"\n",
    "- \"Is it sunny?\" → No → \"Is it raining?\" → Yes → \"Don't play tennis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Decision trees are:\n",
    "- Easy to understand (you can see exactly how decisions are made)\n",
    "- Don't require complex math\n",
    "- Work well with categorical data (like weather conditions)\n",
    "- Form the basis for more advanced algorithms (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OpenShift AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "**OpenShift AI** is Red Hat's platform for building, training, and deploying AI/ML models in enterprise environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A complete workshop for AI projects - it provides:\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebooks** (like this one) for experimentation\n",
    "- **Compute resources** for training models\n",
    "- **Model serving** capabilities for production\n",
    "- **Integration** with your existing IT infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we're using it:** OpenShift AI gives you a professional, enterprise-ready environment to learn and experiment with AI, just like you'd use in real IT operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Creating a visual representation of how our decision tree makes decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is cool:** You can actually SEE how the model thinks! Each node asks a question, each branch is an answer, and each leaf is a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to read it:** Start at the top (root), follow the branches based on conditions, and end at a leaf with the prediction. It's like a flowchart that the algorithm created automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try this:** Pick a weather condition and trace through the tree - can you predict what it will say?"

    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning** learns patterns from data without explicit programming\n",
    "- **Decision Trees** make decisions by asking a series of questions - you can actually see how they think!\n",
    "- **Data preparation** is crucial - ML algorithms need data in the right format (numbers, not text)\n",
    "- **Train/test split** ensures we test on unseen data to verify the model actually learned\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics** (accuracy, precision, recall) tell us how well the model performs\n",
    "- **Visualization** helps us understand and trust the model's decision-making process\n",
    "- **These concepts** apply directly to IT operations - same algorithms, different data\n",
