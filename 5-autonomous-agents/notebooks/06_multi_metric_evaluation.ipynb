    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 06! In this notebook, we'll explore **multi-metric evaluation** using LlamaStack's Evaluation API. We'll learn how to evaluate AI models using both basic and LLM-as-judge scoring functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. **Basic Evaluation** - Using simple scoring functions like `subset_of`\n",
    "2. **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation** - Using an LLM to evaluate responses\n",
    "3. **Multi-Metric Evaluation** - Evaluating with multiple metrics simultaneously\n",
    "4. **Judge Feedback** - Understanding why scores were given\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Evaluation helps you measure AI performance objectively\n",
    "- Multiple metrics give you a comprehensive view of quality\n",
    "- LLM-as-judge provides nuanced evaluation beyond exact matches\n",
    "- Judge feedback helps you understand and improve your models\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",

    "Congratulations! You've successfully completed a multi-metric evaluation. Here's what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Evaluation**: Used `basic::subset_of` to check exact matches\n",
    "2. **LLM-as-Judge Setup**: Configured custom scoring functions with judge prompts\n",
    "3. **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Evaluated responses using multiple criteria simultaneously\n",
    "4. **Result Analysis**: Displayed scores, aggregated results, and judge feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation is essential** for measuring AI performance objectively\n",
    "- **Multiple metrics** provide a comprehensive view of quality\n",
    "- **LLM-as-judge** offers nuanced evaluation beyond exact matches\n",
    "- **Judge feedback** helps understand why scores were given\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try different judge models to see how they compare\n",
    "- Experiment with different prompt templates\n",
    "- Add more evaluation examples\n",
    "- Create custom scoring functions for your specific use case\n",
    "- Use evaluation results to improve your model prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- LlamaStack Evaluation Documentation\n",
    "- LLM-as-Judge Best Practices\n",
    "- Evaluation Metrics Guide\n"
