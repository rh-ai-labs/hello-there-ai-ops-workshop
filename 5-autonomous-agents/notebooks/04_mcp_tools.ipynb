    "## Part 1: What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Understanding MCP - the protocol that lets agents interact with external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** LLMs are just text processors - they can't directly interact with systems. MCP provides a standardized way to connect tools, so agents can actually DO things, not just talk about them!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol for integrating external tools and services with LLMs. It allows agents to:\n",
    "- **Call external APIs** (e.g., check service status, restart services)\n",
    "- **Access databases** (e.g., query incident logs)\n",
    "- **Execute commands** (e.g., run system commands)\n",
    "- **Integrate with other systems** (e.g., monitoring tools, ticketing systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MCP matters:**\n",
    "- LLMs can't directly interact with systems (they're text processors, not system operators!)\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized way to connect tools (one protocol, many tools)\n",
    "- Enables agents to take real actions (check status, restart services, query databases)\n",
    "- Makes agents more powerful and useful (from assistant to operator!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use MCP:**\n",
    "- ✅ Need to interact with external systems (monitoring, ticketing, databases)\n",
    "- ✅ Want agents to take actions (not just answer questions)\n",
    "- ✅ Need real-time data from APIs (current status, metrics, alerts)\n",
    "- ✅ Want to integrate with existing tools (your infrastructure, your way!)\n",

    "**Why:** Tools are what give agents the ability to take actions. Understanding how agents decide which tools to use helps you build better tools and debug agent behavior.\n",

    "2. **Calls** the tool with appropriate parameters (execution: `check_service_status(\"nginx\")`)\n",

    "- **Name**: Identifies the tool (`check_service_status`)\n",
    "- **Description**: Tells the LLM what the tool does (\"Check the status of a system service\")\n",
    "- **Parameters**: What inputs the tool needs (`service_name: str`)\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** provides a standardized protocol for tool integration - one protocol, many tools!\n",
    "2. **Tools** enable agents to take actions, not just answer questions - from thinking to doing!\n",
    "3. **Tool execution** follows a clear pattern: decide → call → receive → use - watch the agent reason and act!\n",
    "4. **MCP servers** can provide terminal access and other capabilities - connect agents to YOUR systems!\n",
    "5. **Security** is important - use whitelists and validation for command execution (safety first!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **MCP** standardizes tool integration - build tools once, use with any agent\n",
    "- **Tools** give agents \"hands\" - they can interact with external systems\n",
    "- **Tool execution** is transparent - you can see what the agent is doing\n",
    "- **Security** is critical - always validate inputs and use whitelists\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Build MCP tools for your monitoring systems, ticketing systems, databases\n",
    "- Give agents access to terminal commands (safely!) for system management\n",
    "- Connect agents to your APIs and services\n",
    "- Create production-ready tools with proper security and validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security considerations:**\n",
    "- ✅ Use command whitelists (only allow safe commands)\n",
    "- ✅ Validate all inputs (never trust user input!)\n",
    "- ✅ Set timeouts on command execution (prevent hanging)\n",
    "- ✅ Run with minimal privileges (principle of least privilege)\n",
    "- ✅ Log all command executions (audit trail)\n",
    "- ✅ Consider sandboxing for production (isolate execution)\n",

    "**Ready for more?** In **Notebook 05**, we'll explore:\n",
    "- **Safety Shields** - Content moderation and safety checks (protect against harmful outputs)\n",
    "- **Content Moderation** - Checking inputs and outputs for safety violations\n",
    "- **Production-ready safety** - Building agents that are safe to deploy\n",
