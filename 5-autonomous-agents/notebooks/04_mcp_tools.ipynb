    "## Part 1: Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Understanding MCP - the protocol that lets agents interact with external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** LLMs are just text processors - they can't directly interact with systems. MCP provides a standardized way to connect tools, so agents can actually DO things, not just talk about them!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol for integrating external tools and services with LLMs. It allows agents to:\n",
    "- **Call external APIs** (e.g., check service status, restart services)\n",
    "- **Access databases** (e.g., query MongoDB collections)\n",
    "- **Execute commands** (e.g., run system commands)\n",
    "- **Integrate with other systems** (e.g., monitoring tools, ticketing systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MCP matters:**\n",
    "- LLMs can't directly interact with systems (they're text processors, not system operators!)\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized way to connect tools (one protocol, many tools)\n",
    "- Enables agents to take real actions (check status, query databases, execute commands)\n",
    "- Makes agents more powerful and useful (from assistant to operator!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP Architecture:**\n",
    "- **MCP Server**: Exposes tools, resources, and prompts (e.g., MongoDB MCP server)\n",
    "- **MCP Client (LlamaStack)**: Connects to MCP servers and makes tools available to agents\n",
    "- **Agent**: Uses tools exposed by MCP servers to take actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook:** We'll use the MongoDB MCP server that's already deployed in OpenShift. The agent will automatically use MongoDB tools to query the database when needed!\n"

    "**What we're doing:** Creating an agent that has access to MongoDB MCP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Agents need to be configured with toolgroups to access MCP tools. Once configured, the agent can automatically decide when to use tools based on the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- `toolgroups`: List of MCP toolgroups the agent can use (e.g., `[\"mcp::mongodb\"]`)\n",
    "- `tool_choice`: Set to `\"auto\"` to let the agent decide when to use tools\n",
    "- `instructions`: Guide the agent on when and how to use tools\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** provides a standardized protocol for tool integration - one protocol, many tools!\n",
    "2. **Agent Configuration** - Agents must be configured with toolgroups to access MCP tools\n",
    "3. **Automatic Tool Usage** - Agents automatically decide when to use tools based on queries\n",
    "4. **Turn-based Interaction** - Agents work through turns: create turn → stream → retrieve results\n",
    "5. **Tool Execution Flow** - Agents call tools, receive results, and generate responses using real data\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **MCP** standardizes tool integration - build tools once, use with any agent\n",
    "- **Agents** automatically use tools when needed - you don't need to explicitly call tools\n",
    "- **Tool execution** is transparent - you can see what tools were called and their results\n",
    "- **Real data** - Agents use actual data from MongoDB, not just training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Build MCP tools for your monitoring systems, ticketing systems, databases\n",
    "- Give agents access to your infrastructure through MCP\n",
    "- Watch agents automatically use tools to answer questions\n",
    "- Create production-ready agents that can actually manage your systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**The workflow:**\n",
    "1. Create agent with MCP toolgroups\n",
    "2. Create session for conversation context\n",
    "3. Query agent (it automatically uses tools!)\n",
    "4. Retrieve turn results to see response and tool usage\n",
    "5. Analyze steps to understand what happened\n",
