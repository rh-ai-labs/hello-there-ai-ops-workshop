    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol for integrating external tools and services with LLMs. It allows agents to:\n",
    "- **Call external APIs** (e.g., check service status, restart services)\n",
    "- **Access databases** (e.g., query incident logs)\n",
    "- **Execute commands** (e.g., run system commands)\n",
    "- **Integrate with other systems** (e.g., monitoring tools, ticketing systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MCP matters:**\n",
    "- LLMs can't directly interact with systems\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized way to connect tools\n",
    "- Enables agents to take real actions\n",
    "- Makes agents more powerful and useful\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use MCP:**\n",
    "- Need to interact with external systems\n",
    "- Want agents to take actions (not just answer questions)\n",
    "- Need real-time data from APIs\n",
    "- Want to integrate with existing tools\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP** provides a standardized protocol for tool integration\n",
    "2. **Tools** enable agents to take actions, not just answer questions\n",
    "3. **Tool execution** follows a clear pattern: decide → call → receive → use\n",
    "4. **MCP servers** can provide terminal access and other capabilities\n",
    "5. **Security** is important - use whitelists and validation for command execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use MCP Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use MCP when:**\n",
    "- ✅ Need to interact with external systems\n",
    "- ✅ Want agents to take actions\n",
    "- ✅ Need real-time data from APIs\n",
    "- ✅ Want to integrate with existing tools\n",
    "- ✅ Need terminal/system command execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't use MCP when:**\n",
    "- ❌ Pure text generation is sufficient\n",
    "- ❌ No external systems to interact with\n",
    "- ❌ Simple Q&A without actions needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating MCP servers for terminal access:\n",
    "- ✅ Use command whitelists\n",
    "- ✅ Validate all inputs\n",
    "- ✅ Set timeouts on command execution\n",
    "- ✅ Run with minimal privileges\n",
    "- ✅ Log all command executions\n",
    "- ✅ Consider sandboxing for production\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Notebook 05**, we'll explore **Safety** features, and in **Notebook 06**, we'll see how to **evaluate** agents using multiple metrics.\n",
