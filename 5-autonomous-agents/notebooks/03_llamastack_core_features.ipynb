    "# Notebook 03: LlamaStack Core Features\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, we'll explore **LlamaStack's core capabilities** - the building blocks that make powerful agents possible. Think of these as the agent's \"superpowers\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. **Simple Chat** - Basic LLM interactions (the foundation)\n",
    "2. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** - Enhancing LLMs with external knowledge (giving agents access to your docs!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Understanding these features helps you build better agents\n",
    "- Each feature solves a specific problem (chat for Q&A, RAG for knowledge)\n",
    "- Combining features creates powerful solutions (chat + RAG = smart assistant with your docs!)\n",
    "- This knowledge prepares you for advanced agent development\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "- ✅ Completed Notebook 02: Building a Simple Agent\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaStack server running (see Module README for setup)\n",
    "- ✅ Ollama running with `llama3.2:3b` model\n",
    "- ✅ Python environment with dependencies installed\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** We'll start with simple chat (easy!) and then add RAG so agents can answer questions about your specific IT operations documentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 How This Applies to IT Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** LLMs are trained on general knowledge, but they don't know about YOUR infrastructure, YOUR procedures, YOUR specific configurations. How do you give agents access to your internal knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)! You store your IT operations documentation in a vector store, and the agent retrieves relevant context when answering questions. It's like giving the agent access to your internal wiki!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world impact:**\n",
    "- **Chat** for general Q&A - \"What is a load balancer?\" (general knowledge)\n",
    "- **RAG** for specific knowledge - \"How do we restart services in our infrastructure?\" (your docs!)\n",
    "- **Combine both** - Agents can answer general questions AND questions about your specific setup\n",
    "- **Production-ready** - Give agents access to your runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** We'll build a vector store with IT operations documentation and watch the agent retrieve relevant context to answer questions. It's like having an assistant that actually reads your documentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand LlamaStack's core capabilities (chat and RAG)\n",
    "- ✅ Know when to use each feature (chat for general Q&A, RAG for domain-specific knowledge)\n",
    "- ✅ See how features work independently (each solves a different problem)\n",
    "- ✅ Be ready to explore MCP tools (Notebook 04), Safety (Notebook 05), and Evaluation (Notebook 06)\n",

    "\n",
    "**What we're doing:** Learning the basics of LLM interactions - sending messages and getting responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Chat is the foundation. Everything else builds on this. It's like learning to walk before you run!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Chat?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chat** is the most basic way to interact with an LLM. It's a conversation where you send messages and receive responses - simple as that!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Message Types**: System (instructions), User (questions), Assistant (responses)\n",
    "- **Streaming vs Non-streaming**: Get responses as they're generated (streaming) or wait for complete response (non-streaming)\n",
    "- **Conversation Context**: LLM remembers previous messages in the conversation (like a real conversation!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Chat:**\n",
    "- ✅ Simple Q&A (\"What is a load balancer?\")\n",
    "- ✅ Text generation (summaries, explanations)\n",
    "- ✅ Basic reasoning tasks (troubleshooting steps)\n",
    "- ❌ Don't use when you need external knowledge or tools (use RAG or MCP instead)\n",

    "**RAG** enhances LLMs with external knowledge by:\n",

    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Chat** is the foundation - basic LLM interactions for Q&A and text generation\n",
    "2. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** gives agents access to YOUR documentation - store docs, retrieve context, answer questions!\n",
    "3. **System prompts** guide the LLM's behavior - set the role, personality, and domain\n",
    "4. **Multi-turn conversations** maintain context - agents remember what you talked about\n",
    "5. **Streaming** provides real-time feedback - see responses as they're generated\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **Chat** for general Q&A - when you need general knowledge\n",
    "- **RAG** for domain-specific knowledge - when you need YOUR docs\n",
    "- **Combine both** - agents can answer general questions AND questions about your specific setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Use **Chat** for general IT questions (\"What is a load balancer?\")\n",
    "- Use **RAG** for your specific procedures (\"How do we restart services in our infrastructure?\")\n",
    "- Store your runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and documentation in vector stores\n",
    "- Give agents access to your internal knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ready for more?** In **Notebook 04**, we'll explore:\n",
    "- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - External tool integration (give agents access to APIs, databases, commands!)\n",
    "- **How to integrate tools** with agents (connect to your monitoring systems, ticketing systems, etc.)\n",
    "- **Building production-ready agents** that can both answer questions AND take actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** You'll learn how to give agents access to your IT infrastructure tools - monitoring APIs, service management, databases, anything!\n",
