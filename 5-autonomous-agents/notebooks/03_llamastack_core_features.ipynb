    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol for integrating external tools and services with LLMs. It allows agents to:\n",
    "- **Call external APIs** (e.g., check service status, restart services)\n",
    "- **Access databases** (e.g., query incident logs)\n",
    "- **Execute commands** (e.g., run system commands)\n",
    "- **Integrate with other systems** (e.g., monitoring tools, ticketing systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MCP matters:**\n",
    "- LLMs can't directly interact with systems\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized way to connect tools\n",
    "- Enables agents to take real actions\n",
    "- Makes agents more powerful and useful\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use MCP:**\n",
    "- Need to interact with external systems\n",
    "- Want agents to take actions (not just answer questions)\n",
    "- Need real-time data from APIs\n",
    "- Want to integrate with existing tools\n",
