    "# Notebook 05: Safety Shields\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, we'll explore **Safety** features in LlamaStack - content moderation and safety shields that protect against harmful or inappropriate content. This is essential for production deployment!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. **What is Safety** - Understanding safety features and why they matter (protect your systems!)\n",
    "2. **Safety Shields** - Registering and using safety shields (Llama Guard 3)\n",
    "3. **Content Moderation** - Checking inputs and outputs for safety (before and after processing)\n",
    "4. **Moderations API** - Detailed category analysis (understand why content was flagged)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Prevents harmful outputs (protect users and systems)\n",
    "- Protects users and systems (safety first!)\n",
    "- Ensures responsible AI deployment (production-ready agents)\n",
    "- Builds trust in AI systems (users trust safe systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "- ✅ Completed Notebook 04: MCP Tools\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaStack server running (see Module README for setup)\n",
    "- ✅ Ollama running with `llama3.2:3b` model\n",
    "- ✅ Ollama running with `llama-guard3` model (for safety shields - run `ollama pull llama-guard3`)\n",
    "- ✅ Python environment with dependencies installed\n",
    "- ✅ Understanding of Chat, RAG, and MCP (from Notebooks 03-04)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** We'll see safety shields in action - watch them detect and block harmful content before it reaches your systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 How This Applies to IT Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** Agents interact with users and systems - what if they receive harmful inputs or generate inappropriate outputs? How do you protect your infrastructure from malicious or inappropriate content?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** Safety shields! Content moderation and safety checks protect your agents (and your systems) from harmful content. Think of it as a firewall for AI - it blocks bad content before it reaches your systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world impact:**\n",
    "- **Protect against malicious inputs** - Block harmful commands, injection attacks, inappropriate requests\n",
    "- **Prevent harmful outputs** - Ensure agents don't generate inappropriate or dangerous responses\n",
    "- **Compliance and trust** - Meet safety requirements and build user trust\n",
    "- **Production-ready** - Essential for deploying agents in production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** We'll use Llama Guard 3 to detect and block harmful content. You'll see safety shields in action - watch them analyze content and decide what's safe and what's not!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what safety features are and why they're important (production-ready agents need safety!)\n",
    "- ✅ Know how to register safety shields (Llama Guard 3)\n",
    "- ✅ Learn how to check content for safety violations (before and after processing)\n",
    "- ✅ Be able to use the moderations API for detailed analysis (understand why content was flagged)\n",
    "- ✅ Understand how to apply safety shields to agents (protect your production systems)\n",

    "**What we're doing:** Checking inputs and outputs for safety violations - protecting your systems from harmful content.\n",

    "- Sensitive information (PII, credentials)\n",
    "- Policy violations (company policies, compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "- ✅ Enable moderation for user-facing applications (protect users)\n",
    "- ✅ Configure appropriate moderation levels (balance safety and usability)\n",
    "- ✅ Log moderation events for review (audit trail)\n",

    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safety shields** protect against harmful or inappropriate content - essential for production deployment!\n",
    "2. **Content moderation** checks inputs and outputs for safety violations - protect your systems!\n",
    "3. **Moderations API** provides detailed category analysis - understand why content was flagged\n",
    "4. **Safety is essential** for production systems and user-facing applications - don't deploy without it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- **Safety shields** are like firewalls for AI - they block harmful content before it reaches your systems\n",
    "- **Content moderation** checks both inputs and outputs - protect against malicious inputs and inappropriate outputs\n",
    "- **Llama Guard 3** provides category-based analysis - understand what type of content was flagged\n",
    "- **Production-ready** agents need safety - don't deploy without proper safety measures!\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Protect agents from malicious inputs (injection attacks, harmful commands)\n",
    "- Prevent agents from generating inappropriate outputs (protect your brand)\n",
    "- Use safety shields for user-facing applications (protect users)\n",
    "- Log moderation events for audit and compliance (audit trail)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use safety:**\n",
    "- ✅ User-facing applications (protect users)\n",
    "- ✅ Production systems (essential!)\n",
    "- ✅ Handling sensitive data (protect sensitive information)\n",
    "- ✅ Public-facing agents (protect your brand)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to use safety:**\n",
    "- ❌ Internal/trusted use cases only (if you trust all users)\n",
    "- ❌ Non-production experiments (testing without safety is OK)\n",
    "- ❌ When performance is critical and safety checks add latency (balance safety and performance)\n",

    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ready for more?** In **Notebook 06**, we'll explore:\n",
    "- **Multi-Metric Evaluation** - Measure AI performance objectively (how good is your agent?)\n",
    "- **LLM-as-a-Judge** - Use LLMs to evaluate responses (automated quality assessment)\n",
    "- **Evaluation best practices** - Understand how to measure agent performance\n",
