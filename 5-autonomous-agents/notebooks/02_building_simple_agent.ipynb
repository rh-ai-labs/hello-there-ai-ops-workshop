    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a simple autonomous agent **step by step** using the LlamaStack SDK directly. You'll see exactly how each component works.\n",

    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. How to connect to LlamaStack using the Python SDK\n",
    "2. How to define tools in the correct format (OpenAI function calling)\n",
    "3. How to create an agent with tools using the SDK\n",
    "4. How to create agent sessions\n",
    "5. How to execute turns and see the agent's reasoning\n",
    "6. How to process streaming responses from the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- You'll understand the **actual API calls** and responses\n",
    "- You'll see **raw LlamaStack outputs** to understand how it works\n",
    "- You'll learn the **fundamentals** before using abstractions\n",
    "- This foundation prepares you for more advanced agents\n",

    "## Part 6: Understanding What Happened\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agent Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what just happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Received**: \"Check the status of the web-server service and restart it if it's down\"\n",
    "2. **Agent Reasoning**: The LLM analyzed the task and decided:\n",
    "   - First, I need to check the service status (use `check_service_status` tool)\n",
    "   - Then, if it's down, restart it (use `restart_service` tool)\n",
    "3. **Tool Selection**: The agent selected appropriate tools based on the task\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**: Tools were executed (in the simulated environment)\n",
    "5. **Response Generation**: The agent synthesized the results and responded\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The agent reasoned** about what to do\n",
    "- **The agent selected tools** based on the task\n",
    "- **The agent executed tools** and got results\n",
    "- **The agent provided a summary** of what was done\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **autonomous agent loop** in action:\n",
    "- **Observe** (read the task)\n",
    "- **Think** (reason about what to do)\n",
    "- **Act** (execute tools)\n",
    "- **Respond** (provide results)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Format**: Tools use OpenAI function calling format with `type`, `function`, `name`, `description`, `parameters`\n",
    "2. **Agent Creation**: Use `client.alpha.agents.create()` with `agent_config` containing model, instructions, and tools\n",
    "3. **Session Creation**: Use `client.alpha.agents.session.create()` to create conversation sessions\n",
    "4. **Turn Execution**: Use `client.alpha.agents.turn.create()` with `stream=True` to see real-time responses\n",
    "5. **Streaming Processing**: Process chunks to extract content from `event.payload.delta.content`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ We saw the **actual SDK calls** and responses  \n",
    "✅ We understood the **exact format** for tools  \n",
    "✅ We saw **raw streaming responses** from LlamaStack  \n",
    "✅ We learned how to **process agent outputs** step by step  \n",
    "✅ We saw the agent **reason and act** autonomously  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Notebook 03, we'll explore LlamaStack's other features (RAG, MCP, Safety, Eval)\n",
    "- In Notebook 04, we'll see how to combine features for advanced agents\n",
    "- Later, we'll see how abstractions can simplify this workflow (but you'll understand what's happening underneath!)\n"
