    "# Notebook 02: Building a Simple Agent with Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 01, we learned about autonomous agents conceptually. Now we're going to **build a real agent** that can actually reason and take actions!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll do:**\n",
    "1. **Set up llamastack** - Connect to the llamastack server for agent capabilities\n",
    "2. **Create an agent** - Build an agent with tools using llamastack API\n",
    "3. **Test the agent** - See the agent reason and take actions autonomously\n",
    "4. **Understand the agent loop** - See how Observe → Think → Act works in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- This is where theory becomes practice\n",
    "- You'll see how an agent actually makes decisions\n",
    "- You'll understand how tools enable agents to take actions\n",
    "- This is the foundation for more advanced agents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LlamaStack?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LlamaStack** is a unified framework for building AI applications. It provides:\n",
    "- **Agent APIs** - For creating and managing autonomous agents\n",
    "- **Tool Integration** - Connect tools (actions) to agents\n",
    "- **LLM Management** - Handle different LLM providers (like Ollama)\n",
    "- **Unified Interface** - One API for all agent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like:** A platform that connects AI reasoning (LLM) with actions (tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Creation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an agent, we need to provide:\n",
    "1. **Instructions** - What the agent should do and how it should behave\n",
    "2. **Tools** - What actions the agent can take\n",
    "3. **Model** - Which LLM to use for reasoning (e.g., Ollama with llama3.2:3b)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agent Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. User gives task → \"Check all services and fix any problems\"\n",
    "2. Agent receives task\n",
    "3. Agent uses LLM to reason about what to do\n",
    "4. Agent selects appropriate tool(s)\n",
    "5. Agent executes tool(s)\n",
    "6. Agent evaluates results\n",
    "7. Agent continues or completes task\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Know how to set up and connect to llamastack\n",
    "- ✅ Understand how to create an agent with tools\n",
    "- ✅ See how agents reason and select tools\n",
    "- ✅ Understand the agent execution flow\n",
    "- ✅ Be ready to build more complex agents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** LlamaStack is **REQUIRED** for this notebook. The agent will not work without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, make sure:\n",
    "- ✅ Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaStack server is running (see `scripts/start_llama_stack.py`)\n",
    "- ✅ Model `llama3.2:3b` is available (`ollama pull llama3.2:3b`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If llamastack is not available, the notebook will fail with an error.**\n",

    "- **Agents reason before acting** - They analyze the situation first\n",
    "- **Agents can use multiple tools** - They chain actions together\n",

    "\n",
    "**Building an agent involves:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment** - Where the agent operates (simulated IT infrastructure)\n",
    "2. **Tools** - Actions the agent can take (check status, restart, scale)\n",
    "3. **LLM** - Provides reasoning capability (via llamastack)\n",
    "4. **Memory** - Stores experiences for learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**The agent workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Task → Agent → Reasoning (LLM) → Tool Selection → Action → Verification → Learning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's next:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 03, we'll explore:\n",
    "- More sophisticated decision-making\n",
    "- Handling failures and retries\n",
    "- Safety checks and validation\n",
    "- Advanced agent patterns\n",
