    "# Notebook 02: Building a Simple Agent with Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, we'll build **real autonomous agents** with tools using LlamaStack. This is where the magic happens - we're moving from concepts to actual working agents!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "1. How to create a custom Wikipedia search tool (no API key needed - perfect for learning!)\n",
    "2. How to create sessions and execute turns (the agent's conversation flow)\n",
    "3. How to see tool calls using AgentEventLogger (watch the agent think and act!)\n",
    "4. How to create custom (client-side) tools (build your own tools!)\n",
    "5. How to use custom tools with agents (put it all together)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- This is where agents go from theory to practice\n",
    "- You'll see agents actually reasoning and taking actions\n",
    "- You'll learn to build tools that agents can use\n",
    "- This is the foundation for building production-ready agents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 How This Applies to IT Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** You need agents that can actually interact with your IT infrastructure - check service status, restart services, scale resources, etc. But how do you give agents these capabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** Custom tools! You build Python functions that agents can call. The agent uses its reasoning to decide when to use each tool, and you get to watch it happen in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world impact:**\n",
    "- **Build custom tools** for your specific infrastructure (check your monitoring system, restart your services, etc.)\n",
    "- **Watch agents reason** about problems and decide which tools to use\n",
    "- **See tool execution** in real-time with AgentEventLogger (🤔 for thinking, 🔧 for tool calls)\n",
    "- **Create production-ready agents** that can actually manage your IT operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** We'll start with Wikipedia (easy to understand) and then build IT operations tools. You'll see the agent check service status, detect problems, and fix them - all autonomously!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "- ✅ Completed Notebook 01: Introduction to Autonomous Agents\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaStack server running (see Module README for setup)\n",
    "- ✅ Ollama running with `llama3.2:3b` model\n",
    "- ✅ Python environment with dependencies installed\n",
    "- ✅ `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`)\n",

    "**The fun part:** We'll start with Wikipedia (no API key needed!) and then build IT operations tools. You'll see agents actually using tools in real-time!\n"

    "**What we're doing:** Creating a **custom Wikipedia search tool** and giving it to an agent.\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Tools** are Python functions with docstrings - the agent detects them automatically (no complex configuration!)\n",
    "2. **Wikipedia Search** is a great example - free, no API key, perfect for learning the pattern\n",
    "3. **Agent Class** simplifies agent creation and tool management - just pass functions and go!\n",
    "4. **AgentEventLogger** shows tool calls visually - watch the agent think (🤔) and act (🔧) in real-time\n",
    "5. **Sessions** maintain conversation context - agents remember what happened before\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big picture:**\n",
    "- Tools are the agent's \"hands\" - they let agents take actions, not just think\n",
    "- Docstrings are critical - the LLM reads them to understand when to use each tool\n",
    "- Client-side tools run in your Python process - fast, secure, no external dependencies\n",
    "- You can build any tool you need - Wikipedia, IT operations, databases, APIs, anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "**For IT operations:**\n",
    "- Build tools for your specific infrastructure (monitoring systems, service management, etc.)\n",
    "- Watch agents reason about problems and choose the right tools\n",
    "- See agents execute multi-step operations (check status → detect problem → fix it)\n",
    "- Create production-ready agents that can actually manage your systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ready for more?** In **Notebook 03**, we'll explore:\n",
    "- **LlamaStack Core Features** - Chat and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n",
    "- **When to use each feature** - Understanding which tool fits which problem\n",
    "- **Building more powerful agents** - Combining features for better results\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fun part:** You'll learn how to give agents access to knowledge bases (RAG) so they can answer questions about your specific infrastructure!\n",
