    "# Notebook 02: Advanced RAG with Multiple Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're an IT support engineer learning advanced semantic search with RAG. Your job today: query a multi-field vector store that combines multiple ticket fields (`short_description`, `content`, and `close_notes`) to find both problems AND solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** This same multi-field RAG approach is how you could build intelligent search systems that understand the full context of incidents - from initial problem reports to diagnostic findings to final resolutions - enabling better pattern recognition and faster problem resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Prerequisites:** \n",
    "- Complete `00_data_ingestion.ipynb` first (it creates both vector stores)\n",
    "- The multi-field vector store will be automatically found by name\n",

    "**What you'll see:** By combining multiple fields (problem description + diagnostic details + resolution steps), the RAG system can find tickets that match both the problem AND the solution, not just the problem description alone.\n",

    "- ✅ Combine multiple ticket fields to create richer RAG documents\n",
    "- ✅ Understand why multi-field RAG outperforms single-field RAG\n",

    "1. **Explore the Data** - Understand the ticket fields and how they're combined\n",

    "### Step 5: Why Multi-Field RAG is Better\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're learning:** Understanding when and why multi-field RAG outperforms single-field RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Knowing the strengths of multi-field RAG helps you decide when to use it in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Queries: Multi-Field vs Single-Field RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple fields (`short_description`, `content`, and `close_notes`) instead of just `short_description` significantly improves retrieval quality for certain types of queries. Here are examples where multi-field RAG outperforms single-field RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Troubleshooting Steps and Solutions**\n",
    "**Query**: \"How do I fix ZTrend crashes when saving files?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-field (short_description only)**: May retrieve tickets about crashes, but won't have the solution steps\n",
    "- **Multi-field**: Retrieves tickets with both the problem description AND the detailed troubleshooting steps from `close_notes`, providing complete answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Historical Context and Resolution**\n",
    "**Query**: \"What was the root cause and resolution for application crashes related to memory issues?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-field**: Only finds tickets mentioning \"crashes\" but misses the diagnostic details and resolution steps\n",
    "- **Multi-field**: Retrieves tickets with full context from `content` (initial problem description) and `close_notes` (diagnostic findings and resolution), enabling comprehensive answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Pattern Recognition Across Problem-Solution Pairs**\n",
    "**Query**: \"What are common solutions for software crashes that involve configuration files?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-field**: Can identify crash-related tickets but can't see the solutions\n",
    "- **Multi-field**: Can match both problem patterns (from `short_description`/`content`) and solution patterns (from `close_notes`), enabling identification of recurring problem-solution patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4: Detailed Technical Information**\n",
    "**Query**: \"Show me tickets where log file analysis revealed the issue\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-field**: May miss tickets where log analysis is only mentioned in `content` or `close_notes`\n",
    "- **Multi-field**: Captures technical details from all fields, ensuring comprehensive retrieval of relevant tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 5: End-to-End Ticket Understanding**\n",
    "**Query**: \"Find tickets where the customer reported a problem, diagnostics were performed, and the issue was resolved by reinstalling software\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-field**: Can't capture the full narrative flow from problem → diagnosis → solution\n",
    "- **Multi-field**: Preserves the complete ticket lifecycle, enabling retrieval based on complex multi-stage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Multi-field RAG is especially powerful for queries that require understanding both the problem AND the solution, or queries that need to match patterns across different stages of the ticket lifecycle.\n"

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to set up and use the built-in RAG tool for ingesting user-provided documents in a vector database and utilizing them during inference via direct retrieval. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- **Multi-field content**: We combined `short_description`, `content`, and `close_notes` fields to create richer document representations, improving the quality of retrieval and context understanding.\n",
    "- **Metadata preservation**: Other fields from the dataset are stored as metadata, allowing for filtering and additional context during retrieval.\n",
    "- **Vector database integration**: The documents are chunked and indexed into ChromaDB using Llama Stack's RAG tool, enabling semantic search over the ticket data.\n",
    "- **Query advantages**: As shown in Section 4, multi-field RAG excels at queries requiring both problem and solution context, pattern recognition across ticket lifecycle stages, and comprehensive technical information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how easy it is to implement RAG with Llama Stack, We'll move on to building a simple agent with Llama Stack next in our [Simple Agents](./Level2_simple_agent_with_websearch.ipynb) notebook."
