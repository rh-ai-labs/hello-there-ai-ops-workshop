    "\n",
    "You're an IT support engineer learning to use semantic search with RAG. Your job today: query a pre-indexed vector database to find IT tickets using semantic similarity - matching meaning, not just keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** This same RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach is how you could build search systems that understand meaning, not just keywords - enabling faster incident resolution by finding similar past problems and their solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Prerequisites:** \n",
    "- Complete `00_data_ingestion.ipynb` first (it creates both vector stores)\n",
    "- The single-field vector store will be automatically found by name\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** Traditional keyword search only finds exact matches. If you search for \"application crashes\", it won't find tickets about \"software failures\" or \"system errors\" - even though they're the same problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** Semantic search understands meaning. It knows that \"application crashes\", \"software failures\", and \"system errors\" are similar concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try this:** After we build the system, search for \"application crashes\" and watch it find tickets with different wording but the same meaning!\n",

    "**What we're learning:** How semantic search differs from traditional keyword search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Understanding the concept helps you see why RAG is powerful for IT operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 Keyword Search (Traditional)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Search: \"application crashes\"\n",
    "Results: Only tickets with exact words \"application\" AND \"crashes\"\n",
    "❌ Misses: \"software failures\", \"system errors\", \"app stops working\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Semantic Search (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Search: \"application crashes\"  \n",
    "Results: Tickets with similar meaning:\n",
    "  ✅ \"application crashes\"\n",
    "  ✅ \"software failures\"  \n",
    "  ✅ \"system errors\"\n",
    "  ✅ \"app stops working\"\n",
    "  ✅ \"program terminates unexpectedly\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. **Indexing:** Convert ticket descriptions into \"embeddings\" (vectors that capture meaning)\n",
    "2. **Querying:** Convert your search query into the same type of embedding\n",
    "3. **Matching:** Find tickets whose embeddings are similar to your query embedding\n",
    "4. **Retrieval:** Return the most semantically similar tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Think of it like:** Instead of matching words, we're matching meanings. The system understands that \"crash\" and \"failure\" mean similar things in context.\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enables semantic search - finding documents by meaning, not just exact keyword matches. The data was indexed in `00_data_ingestion.ipynb`, and now we can search for similar incidents even when they use different words. This is the foundation for intelligent IT operations search systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Real-World Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this applies to IT Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The same RAG approach can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incident Resolution:** \"Find similar incidents to this one\" → Get past solutions\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Search:** Search through documentation and runbooks using natural language\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring problems across incidents\n",
    "- **Root Cause Analysis:** Find incidents with similar symptoms to learn from past diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern is the same:** Index historical data (in `00_data_ingestion.ipynb`) → Query semantically → Retrieve relevant context → Use context to answer questions or suggest solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Your Turn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try this:** Modify the query to search for different types of problems. For example:\n",
    "- \"How do I fix database connection errors?\"\n",
    "- \"What causes slow application performance?\"\n",
    "- \"Find tickets about network issues\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the semantic search finds relevant tickets even with different wording!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎉 You Did It!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've queried your first RAG system! You learned how to use semantic search to find IT tickets by meaning, not just keywords. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned:**\n",
    "- ✅ How to connect to a pre-indexed vector store\n",
    "- ✅ How to query using semantic similarity\n",
    "- ✅ How RAG retrieves relevant context and generates answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. **For multi-field RAG**: Run `00_data_ingestion.ipynb` with `INGESTION_MODE = \"multi-field\"`, then use `02_advanced_rag_with_multiple_fields.ipynb`\n",
    "2. **To re-index data**: Use `00_data_ingestion.ipynb` anytime you need to update the vector store\n",
